# black_pepper

This project includes steps in compiling near-infrared spectroscopic data of black pepper samples. After that, the data is subjected to basic preprocessing such as SNV, MSC, SG1, SG2 before being classified by classic statistical machine learning models such as RandomForest according to origins. In addition, PLS Regression was also applied to predict the Piperine and Essential Oil content in the samples. The special thing is that we have written a type of parameter optimization and variable selection process to help the regression model achieve the best performance.
